Here are my learnings from this realization and process:

1. A good way to know if you should make a change is to ask yourself, if you were starting something from scratch, would you make the same decision?
1. It’s easy to convince yourself why you should not change. This is why it’s so vital to get out of your echo chamber and talk to others.
1. There is never a “good time” for change or something new. However, once you know you determine that you really need to do something, the best time to do it is now.
1. There is no reward without risk.
1. Firm deadlines are powerful motivators.
1. Don’t worry about being perfect. Make it bad, then make it better.
1. Ask stakeholders whose opinion you value for feedback.
